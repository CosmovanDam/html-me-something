    <h1>Heading Out West</h1>
    <p>A retelling of events by Ethan Kovalenko. . .</p>
   </header>
   <p>On the 8th day of the 8th month in the year 2017, I and my mother single-handedly embarked upon an adventure out West. There, we encountered such beauties that remain beyond our beliefs even to this day. We raced upon solid black tarmac through the Texan plains where the sun sets in a golden blaze. We wandered in the white sands in the Land of Enchantment, and we cruised through fiery orange saltflats and pearly dunes til the Sierra Nevada range.</p>

    <h1>A Trip Into the Past</h1>
    <p>Seeing some old world tech. . .</p>
   </header>
   <p>Amidst our escapades on our way to Carlsbad, CA, I entreated upon my mother to stop at Houston to visit the space center (as at the time I was set on being an aerospace engineer and was obsessed with rocketry). She happily agreed and we toured the grounds. We first saw the longhorn cattle on the edges of the base, then we entered into the offices of the command center where famous lines such as, "Houston, we have lift off," were received.</p>
   <p>Then we entered a warehouse, and there lying before us all was the massive full Saturn V rocket which brought the Apollo 11 astronauts out of the surly bonds of Earth. It was magnificent.</p>

    <h1>California Dreamin'</h1>
    <p>Finally reaching Carlsbad. . .</p>

    Finally, after 28 hours of driving and three days of hotels in the plains and deserts of the American Southwest, we had finally arrived. Crossing atop the Sierra Nevada, the glistening Pacific ocean met our eyes in all its glory. We stayed there for only three days with my aunt and grandmother, but what a wonderful experience. The journey there was defintely worth it.
